# RunAs Attached (Local) - 32bit / 64bit

RunAsAttached is a program to locally run a new terminal as another user without spawning a new console window.

Very useful during Penetration Tests to escalate as another user without while having an initial shell.

It mimic the "su" program from UNIX systems but for Windows (natively)
